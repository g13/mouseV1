#    How to use the code    #
#############################

#  The original code was run on DALMA, HPC in New York University Abu Dhabi.

0. Get to a HPC module environment that use SLURM scripts.
    $ git clone git@github.com:g13/mouseV1.git
1. Set parameters in gMap2.m for generating LGN to V1 mapping
2. Set parameters in generate.m for generating connection and strength between V1 neurons
3. Find other global parameters in gg.slurm
4. Create a folder and copy the code in template/ to it.
5. Set global name in sbatch_sim4x3, note that here 12 jobs were submitted, each with 4 cpus.
    (If you want to use different number of cpus, and you are familiar with openmp in FORTRAN, go ahead and modify any of the EIFSep*.f in src/)
6. Match global settings in plotAll4.slurm with sbatch_sim4x3 and set ploting parameters.
7. Submit the simulation with $ ./sbatch_sim4x3

# Most of the parameters are described in correspoding files, Dai et al. and its Supplementary Data.
# For related issues pls send email to wd554@nyu.edu or submit issues on github.
