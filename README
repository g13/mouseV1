#    How to use the code    #
#############################

#  The original code was run on DALMA, HPC in New York University Abu Dhabi.

0. Get to a HPC module environment that use SLURM scripts.
    $ git clone git@github.com:g13/mouseV1.git
1. Set parameters in gMap2.m for generating LGN to V1 mapping
2. Set parameters in generateConMat.m for generating connection and strength between V1 neurons
3. Find other global parameters in gg.slurm and submit the setup job with
    $ sbatch gg.slurm
4. Create a folder and copy the code in template/ to it.
5. Set global name in sbatch_sim4x3, note that here 12 jobs were submitted, each with 4 cpus.
    (If you want to use different number of cpus, and you are familiar with openmp in FORTRAN, go ahead and modify any of the EIFSep*.f in src/)
6. Set simulation parameters (dt, connection strength and more)
7. Submit the simulation with 
    $ ./sbatch_sim4x3

To plot only, match global settings in pA.slurm with sbatch_sim4x3 and set ploting parameters.
# Most of the parameters are described in the correspoding source files and the Supplementary Material of the publication.

####### variable description of ./template/adg_INPUT
dt: time step used in envolving the equations in the simulation in seconds
tfinal: total simulation run time in seconds
iperiod: number of samples in one temporal period, equally spaced.
iseed: seed of random number generator

parameters for the EIF model (Eqn.1 in the paper):
Vthres: membrane potential threshold for action potential
Vreset: resting potential
Vexcit: reversal potential for excitatory input
Vinhib: reversal potential for inhibitory input
Gleak: leaky conductance for excitatory neuron
DeltaT: parameter in the Exponential term 
vTheta: the cutoff potential used to avoid infinity NaN when simulating EIF model.
GleakI: leaky conductance for inhibitory neuron

non-related parameters(redundant or out-dated implementations in the code), ignore:
    tstep1, tstep2, tstep3, tstep4,
    tnrise, tndamp, tau_i_2
    dE, dI, rdexc, raexc, rdinh, rainh, gIIc, gEIc
